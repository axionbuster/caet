//! A judge for cause-effect systems.
//!
//! This crate allows you to simulate an external environment that interacts with your object
//! OO system prototype. This is useful for validating your OO design.
//!
//! ## How does it help me?
//!
//! Writing a simulation implies writing code, but not *real* code that interacts
//! with the actual system (and that would burden you with the details of the system's
//! implementation), but *fake* code that interacts with a *fake* system that you
//! have designed to be as close to the real system as necessary.
//!
//! So, after analyzing your problem, and applying certain design patterns to
//! plan what code you will write, you can use this crate to test your idea by writing
//! lightweight, throwaway, fake code that interacts with your fake system.
//!
//! Unlike real code, it's only supposed to take you one or two hours to flesh out
//! an entire system. And, unlike real code, you can keep it as long as you'd like
//! without worrying about keeping up with the changes in the real system.
//!
//! ### Use cases
//!
//! - Discussion and reflection: You can use this crate to discuss or document your design.
//! - Prototyping: You can use this crate to prototype your design.
//! - Validation: You can use this crate to validate your design.
//! - Mocking: You can use this crate to mock your design. However,
//! you'll also be mocking your implementation, which may or may not be what you want.
//!
//! ### Benefits Profile
//!
//! This crate satisfies this niche:
//!
//! **Moderate accuracy, moderate cost**: You do need to write code, mostly throwaway
//! code at that, so this is more expensive than validating your idea on paper,
//! but it's much cheaper than writing real code.
//!
//! It's often believed that the only way to accurately gauge the quality of a design
//! is to write real code. As they say: you can't know until you try.
//! **No!** This crate is the counterexample to that belief.
//! Save yourself the time and effort of getting stuck with the wrong design,
//! or the pressure to turn your flimsy prototype (with tons of anomalies) as the real thing.
//!
//! What this crate offers you: write a little code about a little part of your system,
//! test your system using a strategic "god" (judge) that controls the universe.
//! Then, see if your object keeps up with the universe. Also, try to get a feel for
//! what it's like to actually turn your architecture into code.
//!
//! Was it too verbose? Was it too complicated? Did it introduce a fundamental
//! anomaly in your system? Did you miss something important?
//! Did you lose flexibility? Did you gain flexibility?
//! What did you feel after getting a taste of your design? Did you like it?
//!
//! You can answer these questions without writing real code, plus, discuss and document
//! your assumptions about the universe and the object's responsibilities.
//!
//! ## How to use this crate to test your OO system or prototype
//!
//! First, there's a full example right here on this page. You might have to scroll
//! to the bottom of the page to see it.
//!
//! And, there's also a more elaborate example in the `lib.rs` file of this crate.
//! It's called `mod test_stack`. It's much bigger than the example on this page,
//! but also comprehensive. It's a simulation of a stack data structure.
//! Look at the example and see if `caet` is a good fit for you.
//!
//! Now, let's get to the details.
//!
//! This crate has exactly three public types:
//! - trait [`Judge`]: A god-like entity that controls the universe and judges the object's reactions.
//! - enum [`Judgment`]: A judgment about an object's reaction evaluated at a particular time.
//! Also contains the next input to the object.
//! - struct [`Outcome`]: The final result of a test.
//!
//! Your job is to implement the trait [`Judge`].
//!
//! And, essentially, one public function:
//! - [`judge`]: The entry point into this crate. This is a test runner.
//! It takes the ownership of your judge implementation and your object,
//! and runs the simulation. Once it's finished, it returns an [`Outcome`].
//!
//! So, it's actually pretty simple. You implement the trait [`Judge`],
//! you implement your object, then you test it by calling [`judge`].
//! That's it.
//!
//! ### First, a synopsis.
//!
//! The `caet` crate is a flexible testing system.
//!
//! Any judge and any object can work together as long as they agree on one thing:
//! the "change" data type.
//!
//! The "change" data type is the type of the object's sensory experiences and reactions.
//! In other words, it really defines (the alphabet of) the language of the universe.
//!
//! That means, anyone that speaks the same language (i.e. uses the same "change" data type)
//! can work together.
//!
//! ### [`Judge`]
//!
//! Start by implementing the trait [`Judge`].
//!
//! There are three associated types you must implement:
//! - **`Change`: A combined observation and reaction type.**
//! - `Fault`: In case a reaction is unacceptable, this type is used to report the reason.
//! - `Error`: A judge can also hit an error, in which case this type is used to report the reason.
//!
//! Though you should define all three, only the first one (`Change`) is relevant to the OO design.
//!
//! The second and third types are essentially for error handling. It's not super important.
//! You can make them `String` if you want.
//!
//! Then, you must implement the trait method [`Judge::next`].
//!
//! Before we discuss [`Judge::next`], you should think of the simulation as some sort of game or battle.
//!
//! The "god" (i.e. the judge) controls the universe and the object.
//! The judge's goal is to defeat the object by making it hit a fault
//! (a rule-breaking or otherwise inappropriate reaction).
//! Meanwhile, the object's goal is to survive the universe by not hitting a fault,
//! and continue until it outsmarts the judge (i.e., ends the simulation).
//! (Of course, you control both, so you can make them as boring or as interesting as you want.)
//!
//! So, the [`Judge::next`] method should be thought of as the judge's next move.
//!
//! Namely, it will read all the reactions of the object that hasn't been judged yet,
//! and then it will decide what to do next.
//!
//! The judge controls the lifetime of the universe. It can end the simulation at any time.
//! The judge is also responsible for judging the object's reactions.
//! Both of these responsibilities are combined in the return value of [`Judge::next`]:
//! - If the judge decides the reaction is acceptable and still has a challenge for the object,
//! it will return `Ok(Judgment::Continue(next_input))` with whatever the `next_input` is.
//! - If the judge decides the reaction is acceptable but has no more challenges for the object,
//! it will return `Ok(Judgment::Done)` to end the simulation.
//! - Lastly, if the judge decides the reaction is unacceptable, it will return
//! `Err(Judgment::Fault(fault))` with whatever the `fault` is. This also ends the simulation.
//!
//! In [`Judge::next`], you'll be implementing the judge's decision-making process.
//!
//! Actually, this single method is the only thing you need to implement, and
//! it conceptually defines the judge's identity and the rules of the universe.
//!
//! ### Your object
//!
//! The definition of an object is any *thing* that reacts to changes in its environment.
//!
//! Because the "thing" concept is so general, it would be unreasonable to require
//! you to define it as some sort of a concrete data type. Instead, in this crate,
//! your object will be represented by a closure, called its **reaction function**.
//!
//! In the signature of [`judge`], you must provide a closure that implements
//! `FnMut(J::Change) -> Vec<J::Change>` where `J` is your implementation of [`Judge`].
//! This closure is your object's reaction function, and, therefore, its representation.
//!
//! Let's break this down.
//!
//! - `FnMut`: The object has private state that it can mutate, which it persists
//! while it is called multiple times.
//! - `(J::Change)`: It makes a passive observation of the universe, though it is
//! actually given by the judge.
//! - `-> Vec<J::Change>`: It reacts to the observation by producing a vector of changes.
//! It's a vector because it can produce multiple changes at once, or none at all.
//! Pay close attention to the doctrine of non-immediacy of reactions: This doctrine
//! says that, unlike observations, reactions are not immediate. In other words,
//! it's possible for the object to bunch up its reactions and produce them all at once
//! as a way to defeat the judge. The judge should generally agree that this is a valid strategy.
//! Otherwise, the judge is at fault. (But of course, this is up to how you implement your judge.
//! I only strongly recommend that you follow this doctrine.)
//!
//! So in summary, the "object" is abstracted away, hidden behind the `FnMut` closure.
//! The `caet` crate will never ever touch it directly. Instead, you will be providing
//! a closure that stands in for your object.
//!
//! In more conventional OOP terms, the closure is a proxy, translating each "request"
//! (or command or event) to your real object, and then translating each "response" (or reaction)
//! back to the judge.
//!
//! But, your proxy can actually get a bit smarter than the underlying object,
//! by bunching up reactions and releasing them all at once perhaps in unpredictable ways.
//! Maybe it will even drop or mutate certain reactions and re-order the reactions.
//! The precise rules for what's allowed and not, and how synchronization is done,
//! should be agreed upon between the judge and the object. This means, it's your job
//! to define how reliable your object's reactions are, whether they are immediate or not,
//! and, in general, how time is understood in your universe.
//!
//! However, the doctrine of the non-immediacy of reactions,
//! and that of the non-reliability of reactions, can provide a good starting point.
//!
//! (But none of the examples given respect them fully. But, they are just examples, anyway.)
//!
//! ### [`judge`] (lowercase)
//!
//! The function [`judge`] takes in exactly two arguments:
//! - **`judge`**: Your implementation of [`Judge`].
//! - **`object`**: Your object. A function closure as described above.
//!
//! It returns an [`Outcome`] type if the judge successfully completes, or [`Judge::Error`],
//! an Judge-associated type, if the judge fails to simulate the universe.
//!
//! Once an [`Outcome`] is produced, you can inspect it to see
//! whether the object has passed or failed the test, and
//! the number of observations (`calls` field) made by the object.
//!
//! Don't forget the check to see if the object passed too early
//! test because, while the object's reactions were acceptable,
//! they went beyond what the judge was expecting, which caused
//! it to prematurely halt the test. That's why the [`Outcome`]
//! type has a iteration count field. Check that field to see
//! if it's way too low.
//!
//! ## Some doctrines that may help
//!
//! Let's first refine the concepts of observations and reactions.
//! They are primitive notions so they can't really be *defined*, but
//! at least, we can say what they are not.
//!
//! ### Observations
//!
//! - **Passive**: The object senses things passively. It can't
//! choose to sense something or not, neither can it arrange
//! some signal to arrive at a certain time. In `caet`, this effect
//! is achieved by letting the judge control all sensations (observations)
//! felt by the object.
//! - **Immediate**: The object's observations are immediate. They are
//! always up-to-date. This also means they always arrive in order.
//! In fact, a "delayed sensation" (or observation) is a contradiction
//! in terms; like a triangle with four corners, it cannot even be imagined.
//! - **Reliable**: Similarly, all observations "felt" by the object are reliable.
//! Again, this is by definition of the very term "observation."
//! Implementation-wise, this means `caet` cannot drop or mutate observations sent by the judge.
//!
//! ### Reactions
//!
//! - **Active**: The object has total and unimpeachable agency over its reactions.
//! Of course, some actions can be disallowed by the judge, but in any case,
//! the object will always be looking out for its own interests.
//! - **Non-immediate**: In the real world, reactions are not immediate.
//! They can also be re-ordered.
//! - **Non-reliable**: Similarly, reactions are not reliable. They can be dropped
//! or mutated.
//!
//! However, `caet` doesn't enforce the non-immediacy and non-reliability doctrines,
//! meaning, a judge implementation may actually demand immediate and reliable reactions.
//!
//! When implementing these doctrines, you do this by letting the reaction function,
//! which is a proxy for your object, control the way reactions are sent over the
//! `Vec<J::Change>` vector. For example, you can bunch up reactions and release them
//! all at once, or you can drop or mutate certain reactions, or you can re-order them.
//!
//! The judge will not know about this, and will only see what's sent over the "wire"
//! (the vector). It's up to you to make sure the judge understands your object's
//! reaction strategy.
//!
//! ### The doctrine of immediacy of observations
//!
//! The object's observations are immediate. They are always up-to-date.
//! This also means they always arrive in order.
//!
//! This is a non-negotiable doctrine. `caet` enforces it.
//!
//! ### The doctrine of reliability of observations
//!
//! Similarly, all observations "felt" by the object are reliable.
//! This means `caet` cannot drop or mutate observations sent from the judge.
//!
//! Again, this is a non-negotiable doctrine. `caet` also enforces it.
//!
//! ### The optional doctrine of non-immediacy of reactions
//!
//! The object's reactions are not immediate. They can be bunched up and
//! released all at once. This is a valid strategy, and the judge should
//! agree to it. Otherwise, the judge is at fault.
//!
//! Philosophically, this is an absolute one, but `caet` doesn't
//! rely on it. It's really up to your judge implementation to either
//! expect immediate reactions or not.
//!
//! What this means is: `caet` doesn't inspect the vector of reactions
//! returned by the object. It just passes it along to the judge.
//! But you can definitely simulate the non-immediacy by
//! buffering the reactions in your implementation of the reaction function.
//!
//! ### The optional doctrine of non-reliability of reactions
//!
//! The object's reactions are not reliable. They can be dropped or mutated.
//! This is a valid strategy, and the judge should agree to it. Otherwise,
//! the judge is at fault.
//!
//! Again, you can say yes or no to this doctrine. `caet` doesn't touch
//! anything, so it's up to you.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The source code provides a more detailed example in the module `test_stack`.
//!
//! But, here, let's do a much simpler one that concisely demonstrates the
//! basic idea of the crate.
//!
//! We model an agent that plays the guessing game.
//!
//! The range of possible numbers is -1000 to 1000, and the agent
//! must guess the correct number within 10 guesses.
//!
//! In this code,
//! 1. We define the universe.
//! 2. We define the judge. (see [`Judge`])
//! 3. We define the object.
//! 4. We test the object with the judge. (see [`judge`])
//!
//! In four steps, we have a working simulation.
//! Now, I can be very sure of the pros and cons (not shown) of my architecture,
//! making me more confident in my design decisions.
//!

//!         // The initial call to `next` is always with an empty vector, given by the `judge`

//!         println!("reactions: {:?}", reactions);
//!         if let Some(reaction) = reactions.last() {
//!             self.count += 1;
//!             if self.count > 10 {
//!                 // Unacceptable: Too many guesses
//!                 return Ok(Judgment::Fault(format!("It was {}.", self.target)));
//!             }
//!             match reaction {
//!                 // Acceptable: Legitimate actions by the agent
//!                 Value(n) if *n == self.target => return Ok(Judgment::Done),
//!                 Value(n) if *n < self.target => return Ok(Judgment::Continue(TooLow)),
//!                 Value(n) if *n > self.target => return Ok(Judgment::Continue(TooHigh)),
//!                 // Unacceptable: Faulty implementation of the agent

//!                     reaction
//!                 ))),
//!             }
//!         }
//!
//!         // In reality, according to the doctrine of non-immediacy of reactions,
//!         // the object can bunch up its reactions and produce them all at once,
//!         // which is, by the doctrine, a valid strategy. If I followed this

//!         // expecting the object to react immediately. But, I'm not following
//!         // the doctrine for the sake of simplicity.
//!
//!         // (Of course, the doctrine does allow for the possibility of adding
//!         // synchronization primitives to the universe, after which
//!         // the object *must* react "soon," or the judge will keep waiting
//!         // until it's waited "too long" and fails the object. But that's
//!         // not relevant here.)
